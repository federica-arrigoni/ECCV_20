The Matlabe code contains two demo scripts:
- DEMO_images: to run the method on raw images, including feature extraction and matching
- DEMO_ourdata: to compute missclassification error on our images using pre-computed data

In order to run the code on raw images, the following packages are needed: 
- RPA https://fusiello.github.io/demo/rpa/index.html
- VLFeat http://www.vlfeat.org/
